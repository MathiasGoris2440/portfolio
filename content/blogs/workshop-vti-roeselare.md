description: "Organizing and presenting an MQTT workshop for IT students at VTI Roeselare, detailing our preparation, execution, and reflections on the experience"

On November 24th, our team, consisting of Bo Brugghe, Senne Vandecasteele, and myself, faced a challenging task - organizing a workshop on MQTT for the IT students of VTI Roeselare as part of our course on Professional Networking. Prior to this day, we collaborated intensively to create an engaging and informative session.

## Preparation and Ideation

It all started with brainstorming the topic of the workshop. After much discussion and consideration, Bo and Senne decided to focus on MQTT, a protocol that is becoming increasingly important in the world of IT and IoT. Since I was less familiar with MQTT, I spent my time explaining our school, Howest, and our Applied Informatics program while also preparing the PowerPoint presentation.

While I worked on the presentation, Bo and Senne focused on the MQTT segment. They decided that to properly explain MQTT and provide a concrete example, it was necessary to explain various related technologies, including Raspberry Pi, Docker, Portainer, Home Assistant, Grafana, and Docker Compose. This would allow us to demonstrate a practical example to the students following the explanations.

## Workshop Day

On the day of the workshop, we gathered at 10 AM in front of the gate of VTI Roeselare, ready to enter the classroom together. After setting everything up, the students slowly started to trickle in. We were ready to start our workshop.

For an hour and a half, we led the workshop, with each of us presenting our assigned sections. Despite a few minor issues during the demonstration of the example, we managed to resolve them quickly and kept the workshop running smoothly.

## Reflection

Personally, I found the workshop to be a mix of stress and excitement. It was a challenging experience to stand in front of the class and share my knowledge, but it was also great to see how the students responded to the information and the example we had prepared. It was a valuable opportunity to improve both my presentation and teamwork skills, and I am proud of what our team accomplished.
