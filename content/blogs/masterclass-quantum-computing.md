On March 14th, I was immersed in the intriguing world of quantum computing during a captivating masterclass. Together with a group of friends, I headed to the new Howest building where the masterclass was held. Led by IBM Quantum Ambassadors, the afternoon promised to provide a deep understanding of the revolutionary impact of quantum computing on various fields.

## Exploring Quantum Computing

The masterclass began at 2 PM and lasted for about 2 hours. From the very start, I was fascinated by the explanations and demonstrations presented to us. The ambassadors took us on a journey through the basic principles of quantum computing, revealing how this technology pushes the boundaries of traditional computers.

After an hour full of valuable information, there was a well-deserved break. This gave us the opportunity to reflect on what we had learned and discuss how quantum computing is changing our understanding of information processing.

## The Challenge and the Quiz

Following the break, we had another hour of intensive material, delving deeper into the more complex aspects of quantum computing. Personally, I found these parts more challenging, but nonetheless extremely interesting. It was an opportunity to deepen my understanding and strive for a more complete picture of this emerging technology.

To conclude the masterclass, there was a quiz to test our understanding. Unfortunately, I didn't win the quiz, but I was proud to finish in the top 10. It was a fun challenge that encouraged us to apply and reinforce our knowledge.

## Reflection and Conclusion

After the class, there was a pleasant surprise in the form of an open bar, where we could get free drinks. This gave us the chance to chat with fellow students and share our impressions of the masterclass.

All in all, it was a day of discovery and growth. While I found some parts of the lesson more difficult to follow, it was precisely this challenge that sparked my interest. Quantum computing remains a fascinating field that I am eager to explore further.

The masterclass on quantum computing broadened my horizons and sparked my curiosity. I look forward to learning more about this exciting field and seeing the transformative impact it will have on our world.
